\subsection{Detailed Description}
Class representing a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_food}{Food}} sensor. 

This is a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_food}{Food}} sensor class that takes in the the position of the entity being sensed it then calculates the reading based on the position of that entity and its own position which it holds. This class inherits from base sensor and most of the work is done in that class. Sensors are fed readings and return them when prompted. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
